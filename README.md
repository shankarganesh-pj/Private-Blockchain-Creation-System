Private Blockchain Creation System

Private Blockchain Creation System
The Private Blockchain Creation System is a platform that allows users with limited technical proficiency to create a private blockchain consisting of 5 validators. The system is designed to deploy the private blockchain on their own AWS account in as few steps as possible, with an ideal solution being a one-click process. The system uses the Ethereum blockchain technology and the Clique proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus algorithm, which requires a fixed set of validators.

Features
The Private Blockchain Creation System offers the following features:

One-click deployment of a private blockchain on AWS.
Easy-to-use user interface for non-technical users.
Ethereum blockchain technology for secure transactions.
Clique proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus algorithm for efficient validation.
Scalable infrastructure to support increasing demand.
Multichain support using parachain to support multiple blockchains on the same network.
AWS QLDB for secure and reliable transaction logging.
Advantages
The Private Blockchain Creation System offers the following advantages:

Secure and efficient transaction processing with the Ethereum blockchain technology.
Efficient validation with the Clique proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus algorithm.
Scalable infrastructure to support increasing demand.
Multichain support using parachain to support multiple blockchains on the same network.
Secure and reliable transaction logging with AWS QLDB.
Choosing a Consensus Algorithm: Clique Proof-of-Authority (PoA)
The consensus algorithm determines how nodes in the network agree on the state of the blockchain. For this system, we use the Clique proof-of-authority (PoA) consensus algorithm, which requires a fixed set of validators. This algorithm is ideal for private blockchain networks, as it offers faster transaction processing and increased security compared to other consensus algorithms.

Enhanced Proof of Signature for Financial Banks
For financial banks, the system offers an enhanced Proof of Signature feature that ensures that all transactions are verified and approved by authorized personnel. This feature adds an additional layer of security to the blockchain network, ensuring that only authorized personnel can initiate and approve transactions.

Multichain Support Using Parachain
The system supports multiple blockchains on the same network using parachain technology. This allows users to create and manage multiple blockchains on the same network, each with its own set of validators and transaction logs. The system ensures that the data on each blockchain is kept separate and secure, preventing any unauthorized access or tampering.

Implementation Details
The Private Blockchain Creation System is implemented using the following technologies:

AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure management and automation.
AWS Fargate for containerization and deployment of the geth client nodes.
AWS Elastic Container Service (ECS) for container orchestration and management.
Kubernetes (k8s) for additional container orchestration and management.
AWS Quantum-Safe Key Exchange for secure key exchange between the nodes.
AWS Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) for firewall and security management.
AWS QLDB for secure and reliable transaction logging.
The system is designed with scalability in mind, with the ability to add additional nodes as demand increases. The system also uses AWS Quantum-Safe Key Exchange for secure key exchange between the nodes, ensuring that all transactions are secure and protected from unauthorized access.

Implementation Details
Setting Up AWS Environment
Create a new AWS account or use an existing one.
Create a VPC (Virtual Private Cloud) and configure its subnets, routing tables, and security groups.
Launch an EC2 instance with the Ubuntu 20.04 LTS AMI (Amazon Machine Image).
Create an IAM role with the required permissions to interact with AWS services like S3, CloudFormation, and EC2.
Assign the IAM role to the EC2 instance.
Setting Up Ethereum Network
Install Geth client on the EC2 instance using the following command:

bash
Copy code
sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:ethereum/ethereum
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y ethereum
Create a new directory to store the chain data and configuration files:

bash
Copy code
mkdir /home/ubuntu/ethereum
cd /home/ubuntu/ethereum
Create a new Genesis block for the private network:

bash
Copy code
geth --datadir /home/ubuntu/ethereum init /home/ubuntu/genesis.json
Create a new account for the validator nodes:

bash
Copy code
geth --datadir /home/ubuntu/ethereum account new
Start the first validator node:

bash
Copy code
geth --datadir /home/ubuntu/ethereum --networkid 1234 --nodiscover --mine --rpc --rpcaddr "0.0.0.0" --rpcapi "db,eth,net,web3,personal,miner" --allow-insecure-unlock console 2>> /home/ubuntu/ethereum/node1.log
Note: Replace --nodiscover with --bootnodes parameter in case of a multi-node setup.

Initialize the second validator node:

bash
Copy code
geth --datadir /home/ubuntu/ethereum init /home/ubuntu/genesis.json
Copy the keystore file for the account created in step 4 to the new node:

bash
Copy code
scp /home/ubuntu/ethereum/keystore/* user@node2:/home/user/ethereum/keystore/
Start the second validator node:

bash
Copy code
geth --datadir /home/user/ethereum --networkid 1234 --port 30304 --nodiscover --mine --rpc --rpcaddr "0.0.0.0" --rpcapi "db,eth,net,web3,personal,miner" --allow-insecure-unlock console 2>> /home/user/ethereum/node2.log
Note: Replace --nodiscover with --bootnodes parameter in case of a multi-node setup.

Repeat steps 6-8 for the remaining validator nodes.

Using AWS CloudFormation for Automation
Create a new CloudFormation stack using the template.yml file provided in the GitHub repository.
Enter the required parameters like the VPC ID, subnet IDs, and security group IDs.
Review the stack details and create the stack.
Wait for the stack creation to complete.



Implementation Details:

The implementation involves a set of AWS CloudFormation templates and scripts that automate the creation and configuration of the private Ethereum network.
The templates are written in YAML format and define the infrastructure required to deploy the network on AWS.
The scripts are written in Python and utilize the AWS SDK to interact with AWS services and automate various tasks.

Implementation Details
The private blockchain system is implemented using AWS services such as Fargate, Amazon ECS cluster, k8s, AWS QLDB, Quantum-Safe Key Exchange, and AWS VPC for firewall and scalability. The system uses AWS CloudFormation for infrastructure as code.

The aws-ecs-template.yml file contains the AWS ECS template, which defines the resources required to run the private blockchain system on AWS Fargate. The template creates an ECS cluster, task definition, and a service to run the task.

The aws-qlb-template.yml file contains the AWS QLDB template, which defines the resources required to create the QLDB ledger. The template creates a QLDB ledger and a key exchange to protect the ledger.

The deploy.sh script deploys the private blockchain system on AWS. The script creates the required AWS resources using AWS CloudFormation and then runs the geth script and QLDB script to initialize the private blockchain system.

The geth-script.sh script initializes the geth client on each node in the private blockchain network.
